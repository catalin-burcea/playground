## Decorator - A Structural Design Pattern

The decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects in the same class. 

**Examples**

* Suppose we have a Christmas tree object and we want to decorate it. The decoration does not change the object itself; itâ€™s just that in addition to the Christmas tree, we're adding some decoration items like garland, tinsel, tree-topper, bubble lights.
* Pizza with toppings.
