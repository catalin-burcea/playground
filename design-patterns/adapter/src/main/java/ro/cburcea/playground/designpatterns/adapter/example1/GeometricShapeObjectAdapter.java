/**
 * An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly.
 * An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.
 *
 * The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects. It's usually implemented once the application is designed.
