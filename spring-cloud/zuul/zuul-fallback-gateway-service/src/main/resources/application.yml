# Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul uses Netflixâ€™s Ribbon to perform client-side load balancing.
# By default, Ribbon would use Netflix Eureka for service discovery. For this simple example, you can skip service discovery, so set ribbon.eureka.enabled to false.
# Since Ribbon now cannot use Eureka to look up services, we must specify a url for the book service.
# The request will be executed in HystrixCommand via Ribbon.
